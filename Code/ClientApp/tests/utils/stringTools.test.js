  "descriptionEnUs": "<p>Pneumonia is an infection in one or both of the lungs. Many germs, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, can cause pneumonia. You can also get pneumonia by inhaling a liquid or chemical. People most at risk are older than 65 or younger than 2 years of age, or already have health problems.<br />Symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe. See your doctor promptly if you</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have a high fever</li>\r\n<li>Have shaking chills</li>\r\n<li>Have a cough with phlegm that doesn't improve or gets worse</li>\r\n<li>Develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities</li>\r\n<li>Have chest pain when you breathe or cough</li>\r\n<li>Feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your doctor will use your medical history, a physical exam, and lab tests to diagnose pneumonia. Treatment depends on what kind you have. If bacteria are the cause, antibiotics should help. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it.<br />Preventing pneumonia is always better than treating it. Vaccines are available to prevent pneumococcal pneumonia and the flu. Other preventive measures include washing your hands frequently and not smoking.<br /><br />NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</p>\r\n<h1>Detailed Information</h1>\r\n<p>Pneumonia is a bacterial, viral, or fungal infection of one or both sides of the lungs that causes the air sacs, or alveoli, of the lungs to fill up with fluid or pus. Symptoms can be mild or severe and may include a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), fever, chills, and trouble breathing. Many factors affect how serious pneumonia is, such as the type of germ causing the lung infection, your age, and your overall health. Pneumonia tends to be more serious for children under the age of five, adults over the age of 65, people with certain conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, or COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or people who have weak immune systems due to HIV/AIDS, chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer), or organ or blood and marrow stem cell transplant procedures.<br /> <br /> To diagnose pneumonia, your doctor will review your medical history, perform a physical exam, and order diagnostic tests. This information can help your doctor determine what type of pneumonia you have. If your doctor suspects you got your infection while in a hospital, you may be diagnosed with hospital-acquired pneumonia. If you have been on a ventilator to help you breathe, you may have ventilator-associated pneumonia. The most common form of pneumonia is community-acquired pneumonia, which is when you get an infection outside of a hospital.<br /> <br /> Treatment depends on whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi are causing your pneumonia. If bacteria are causing your pneumonia, you usually are treated at home with oral antibiotics. Most people respond quickly to treatment. If your symptoms worsen you should see a doctor right away. If you have severe symptoms or underlying health problems, you may need to be treated in a hospital. It may take several weeks to recover from pneumonia.</p>\r\n<div id=\"causes\" class=\"accordion-header-secondary ui-accordion-header ui-corner-top ui-state-default ui-accordion-icons ui-accordion-header-active ui-state-active\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Causes - Pneumonia\">\r\n<h2 class=\"field field--name-field-display-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">Causes</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"ui-id-12\" class=\"ui-accordion-content ui-corner-bottom ui-helper-reset ui-widget-content ui-accordion-content-active\" style=\"height: 100%;\">\r\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-expanding-content field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__item\">\r\n<div class=\"readMoreContainer paragraph paragraph--type--intro-text paragraph--view-mode--default\">\r\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\r\n<div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\">\r\n<p>Bacteria, viruses, and fungi infections can cause pneumonia.

Many types of bacteria can cause bacterial pneumonia. <em>Streptococcus</em>&nbsp;<em>pneumoniae</em> or pneumococcus bacteria are the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia in the United States.</p>\r\n<p>If your pneumonia is caused by one of the following types of bacteria, it is called atypical pneumonia.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Legionella pneumophila.</em></strong>&nbsp;This type of pneumonia sometimes is called Legionnaire's disease, and it has caused serious outbreaks. Outbreaks have been linked to exposure to cooling towers, whirlpool spas, and decorative fountains.</li>\r\n<li><strong><em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em></strong><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;This is a common type of pneumonia that usually affects people younger than 40 years old. People who live or work in crowded places like schools, homeless shelters, and prisons are at higher risk for this type of pneumonia. It's usually mild and responds well to treatment with antibiotics. However,&nbsp;<em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>&nbsp;can be very serious. It may be associated with a skin rash and <span class=\"entity-embed full\">hemolysis</span>. This type of bacteria is a common cause of &ldquo;walking pneumonia&rdquo;.</li>\r\n<li><em><strong>Chlamydia pneumoniae.</strong></em>&nbsp;This type of pneumonia can occur all year and often is mild. The infection is most common in people 65 to 79 years old.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own or develop after you've had a viral cold or the flu. Bacterial pneumonia often affects just one lobe, or area, of a lung.

But some people are at risk&nbsp;for developing more severe pneumonia or potentially fatal complications.</p>\r\n<h3>Signs and Symptoms</h3>\r\n<p>See your doctor promptly if you have the following signs and symptoms:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have a high fever</li>\r\n<li>Have shaking chills</li>\r\n<li>Have a cough with phlegm (a slimy substance), which doesn't improve or worsens</li>\r\n<li>Develop shortness of breath with normal daily activities</li>\r\n<li>Have chest pain when you breathe or cough</li>\r\n<li>Feel suddenly worse after a cold or the flu</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If you have pneumonia, you also may have other symptoms, including nausea (feeling sick to the stomach), vomiting, and diarrhea.</p>\r\n<p>Symptoms may vary in certain populations. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Or, they may vomit, have a fever and cough, or appear restless, sick, or tired and without energy.</p>\r\n<p>Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. If they already have a lung disease, it may get worse. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness.</p>\r\n<h3>Complications</h3>\r\n<p>Often, people who have pneumonia can be successfully treated&nbsp;and do not have complications. Possible complications of pneumonia may include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bacteremia</strong> <strong>and septic shock.</strong> <span class=\"entity-embed full\">Bacteremia</span> is a serious complication in which bacteria from the initial site of infection spread into the blood. It may lead to <span class=\"entity-embed full\">septic shock</span>, a potentially fatal complication.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Lung abscesses.</strong>&nbsp;<span class=\"entity-embed full\">Lung abscesses</span> usually are treated with antibiotics. Sometimes surgery or drainage with a needle is needed to remove the pus.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pleural effusions, empyema, and pleurisy. </strong>These painful or even potentially fatal complications can occur if pneumonia is not treated. The pleura is a membrane that consists of two large, thin layers of tissue. One layer wraps around the outside of your lungs and the other layer lines the inside of your chest cavity. Pleurisy is when the two layers of the pleura become irritated and inflamed, causing sharp pain each time you breathe in. The pleural space is a very thin space between the two pleura. Pleural effusions are the build-up of fluid in the pleural space. If the fluid becomes infected, it is called empyema. If this happens, you may need to have the fluid drained through a chest tube or removed with surgery.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Renal failure</strong></li>\r\n<li><strong>Respiratory failure</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div id=\"diagnosis\" class=\"accordion-header-secondary ui-accordion-header ui-corner-top ui-state-default ui-accordion-icons ui-accordion-header-active ui-state-active\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Diagnosis - Pneumonia\">\r\n<h2 class=\"field field--name-field-display-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">Diagnosis</h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"ui-id-16\" class=\"ui-accordion-content ui-corner-bottom ui-helper-reset ui-widget-content ui-accordion-content-active\" style=\"height: 100%;\">\r\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-expanding-content field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__item\">\r\n<div class=\"readMoreContainer paragraph paragraph--type--intro-text paragraph--view-mode--default\">\r\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\r\n<div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\">\r\n<p>Sometimes pneumonia is hard to diagnose because it may cause symptoms&nbsp;commonly seen in people with colds or the flu. You may not realize it's more serious until it lasts longer than these other conditions. Your doctor will diagnose pneumonia based on your medical history, a physical exam, and test results. Your doctor may be able to diagnose you with a certain type of pneumonia based on how you got your infection and the type of germ causing your infection.</p>\r\n<h3>Medical history</h3>\r\n<p>Your doctor will ask about your&nbsp;signs and symptoms&nbsp;and how and when they began. To find out whether you have bacterial, viral, or fungal pneumonia, your doctor also may ask about:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Any recent traveling you've done</li>\r\n<li>Your hobbies</li>\r\n<li>Your exposure to animals</li>\r\n<li>Your exposure to sick people at home, school, or work</li>\r\n<li>Your past and current medical conditions, and whether any have gotten worse recently</li>\r\n<li>Any medicines you take</li>\r\n<li>Whether you smoke</li>\r\n<li>Whether you've had flu or pneumonia vaccinations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Physical exam</h3>\r\n<p>Your doctor will listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. If you have pneumonia, your lungs may make crackling, bubbling, and rumbling sounds when you inhale. Your doctor also may hear wheezing. Your doctor may find it hard to hear sounds of breathing in some areas of your chest.</p>\r\n<h3>Diagnostic tests</h3>\r\n<p>If your doctor thinks you have pneumonia, he or she may recommend one or more of the following tests.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Chest x ray&nbsp;to look for inflammation in your lungs. A chest x ray is the best test for diagnosing pneumonia. However, this test won't tell your doctor what kind of germ is causing the pneumonia.</li>\r\n<li>Blood tests&nbsp;such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infection.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Blood culture</strong> to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream. If so, your doctor can decide how to treat the infection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Your doctor may recommend other tests if you're in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sputum test.</strong>&nbsp;Your doctor may collect a sample of sputum (spit) or phlegm (slimy substance from deep in your lungs) that was produced from one of your deep coughs and send the sample to the lab for testing. This may help your doctor find out if bacteria are causing your pneumonia. Then, he or she can plan your treatment.</li>\r\n<li>Chest computed tomography (CT) scan to see how much of your lungs is affected by your condition or to see if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions. A CT scan shows more detail than a chest x ray.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pleural fluid culture.</strong>&nbsp;For this test, a fluid sample is taken from the pleural space (a thin space between two layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity). Doctors use a procedure called&nbsp;thoracentesis&nbsp;to collect the fluid sample. The fluid is studied for bacteria that may cause pneumonia.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Pulse oximetry.</strong>&nbsp;For this test, a small sensor is attached to your finger or ear. The sensor uses light to estimate how much oxygen is in your blood. Pneumonia can keep your lungs from moving enough oxygen into your bloodstream. If you're very sick, your doctor may need to measure the level of oxygen in your blood using a blood sample. The sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist. This test is called an arterial blood gas test.</li>\r\n<li>Bronchoscopy is a procedure used to look inside the lungs' airways. If you're in the hospital and treatment with antibiotics isn't working well, your doctor may use this procedure. Your doctor passes a thin, flexible tube through your nose or mouth, down your throat, and into the airways. The tube has a light and small camera that allow your doctor to see your windpipe and airways and take pictures. Your doctor can see whether something is blocking your airways or whether another factor is contributing to your pneumonia. Your doctor may use this procedure to collect samples of fluid from the site of pneumonia (called bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL) or to take small biopsies of lung tissue to help find the cause of your pneumonia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Types of pneumonia</h3>\r\n<p>Your doctor may also diagnosis you with a certain type of pneumonia. Pneumonia is named for the way in which a person gets the infection or for the germ that causes the infection.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).</strong> CAP is the most common type of pneumonia and is usually caused by pneumococcus bacteria. Most cases occur during the winter. CAP occurs outside of hospitals and other health care settings. Most people get CAP by breathing in germs (especially while sleeping) that live in the mouth, nose, or throat.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia (HAP)</strong>. HAP is when people catch pneumonia during a hospital stay for another illness. HAP tends to be more serious than CAP because you're already sick. Also, hospitals tend to have more germs that are resistant to antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial pneumonia.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).</strong> VAP is when people who are on a&nbsp;ventilator machine to help them breathe get pneumonia.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Atypical pneumonia</strong>. Atypical pneumonia is a type of CAP. It is caused by lung infections with less common bacteria than the pneumococcus bacteria that cause CAP. Atypical bacteria include <em>Legionella pneumophila,&nbsp;Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Aspiration pneumonia</strong>. This type of pneumonia can occur if you inhale food, drink, vomit, or saliva from your mouth into your lungs. This may happen if something disturbs your normal gag reflex, such as a brain injury, swallowing problem, or excessive use of alcohol or drugs. Aspiration pneumonia can cause lung abscesses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div id=\"treatment\" class=\"accordion-header-secondary ui-accordion-header ui-corner-top ui-state-default ui-accordion-icons ui-accordion-header-active ui-state-active\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Treatment - Pneumonia\">\r\n<h2 class=\"field field--name-field-display-title field--type-string field--label-hidden field__item\">Treatment<span class=\"ui-helper-hidden-accessible\"><br /></span></h2>\r\n</div>\r\n<div id=\"ui-id-17\" class=\"ui-accordion-content ui-corner-bottom ui-helper-reset ui-widget-content ui-accordion-content-active\" style=\"height: 100%;\">\r\n<div class=\"field field--name-field-expanding-content field--type-entity-reference-revisions field--label-hidden field__item\">\r\n<div class=\"readMoreContainer paragraph paragraph--type--intro-text paragraph--view-mode--default\">\r\n<div class=\"bodytext\">\r\n<div class=\"clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item\">\r\n<p>Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia you have, the germ causing your infection, and how severe your pneumonia is. Most people who have community-acquired pneumonia&mdash;the most common type of pneumonia&mdash;are treated at home. The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and prevent complications.</p>\r\n<h3>Bacterial pneumonia</h3>\r\n<p>Bacterial pneumonia is treated with medicines called antibiotics. You should take antibiotics as your doctor prescribes. You may start to feel better before you finish the medicine, but you should continue taking it as prescribed. If you stop too soon, the pneumonia may come back.</p>\r\n<p>Most people begin to improve after one to three days of antibiotic treatment. This means that they should feel better and have fewer symptoms such as&nbsp;cough and fever.</p>\r\n<h3>Viral pneumonia</h3>\r\n<p>Antibiotics don't work when the cause of pneumonia is a virus. If you have viral pneumonia, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat it. Viral pneumonia usually improves in one to three weeks.</p>\r\n<h3>Treating severe symptoms</h3>\r\n<p>You may need to be treated in a hospital if:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your symptoms are severe</li>\r\n<li>You're at risk for complications because of other health problems</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>If the level of oxygen in your bloodstream is low, you may receive&nbsp;oxygen therapy. If you have bacterial pneumonia, your doctor may give you antibiotics through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein.</p>\r\n<h3>General treatment advice and follow-up care</h3>\r\n<p>If you have pneumonia, follow your treatment plan, take all medicines as prescribed, and get follow-up medical care.</p>\r\n<div id=\"living-with\" class=\"accordion-header-secondary ui-accordion-header ui-corner-top ui-state-default ui-accordion-icons ui-accordion-header-active ui-state-active\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Living With - Pneumonia\">\r\n<h2 class=\"field field--name-field-display-title field--type-string field--la",

Your body can also lose heat faster than you can produce it. That can cause hypothermia, or abnormally low body temperature. It can make you sleepy, confused, and clumsy. Because it happens gradually and affects your thinking, you may not realize you need help. That makes it especially dangerous. A body temperature below 95&deg; F is a medical emergency and can lead to death if not treated promptly.</p>\r\n<p>Anyone who spends much time outdoors in cold weather can get hypothermia. You can also get it from being cold and wet, or under cold water for too long. Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping in a cold room.</p>\r\n<p>A serious emergency leading to an exposure to extreme cold are winter storms. Winter storms can bring extreme cold, freezing rain, snow, ice, and high winds. Staying safe and warm can be a challenge.

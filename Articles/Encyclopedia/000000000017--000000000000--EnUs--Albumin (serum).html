<p>
Serum albumin is the most abundant blood plasma protein and is produced in the liver and forms 
a large proportion of all plasma protein. The human version is human serum albumin, and it 
normally constitutes about 50% of human plasma protein.
</p>

<h1>Function</h1>
<p>
Albumin helps keep fluid in your bloodstream so it does not leak into other tissues. It  
also carries various substances throughout your body, including hormones, vitamins, and enzymes. 
Low albumin levels can indicate a problem with your liver or kidneys.
</p>

<h1>Clinical use</h1>
<p>
An albumin blood test is a type of liver function test. Liver function tests are blood 
tests that measure different enzymes and proteins in the liver, including albumin. An albumin 
test may also be part of a comprehensive metabolic panel, a test that measures several 
substances in your blood. These substances include electrolytes, glucose, and proteins 
such as albumin.  
</p>

<h1>Levels</h1>
<p>
The normal range of human serum albumin in adults (> 3 y.o.) is 3.5 to 5 g/dL. For children 
less than three years of age, the normal range is broader, 2.9â€“5.5 g/dL.
</p>
<p>
Low albumin (hypoalbuminemia) may be caused by liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, burns, 
protein-losing enteropathy, malabsorption, malnutrition, late pregnancy, artefact, genetic 
variations and malignancy.
</p>
<p>
High albumin (hyperalbuminemia) is almost always caused by dehydration. In some cases of 
retinol (Vitamin A) deficiency, the albumin level can be elevated to high-normal values 
(e.g., 4.9 g/dL). This is because retinol causes cells to swell with water (this is also the 
reason too much Vitamin A is toxic).

<p>
<b>Alanine transaminase (ALT)</b>, also known as <b>alanine aminotransferase (ALAT)</b> is an enzyme 
found primarily in the liver and kidney. It was originally referred to as <b>serum 
glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT)</b> and was first characterized in the mid-1950s by 
Arthur Karmen and colleagues.
</p>

<h1>Clinical significance</h1>
<p>
ALT is found in plasma and in various body tissues but is most common in the liver. Serum ALT level, 
serum AST (aspartate transaminase) level, and their ratio (AST/ALT ratio) are commonly measured 
clinically as biomarkers for liver health. The tests are part of blood panels.
</p>

<p>
Normally, a low level of ALT exists in the serum. ALT is increased with liver damage and is used 
to screen for and/or monitor liver disease. The typical reference intervals for ALT are:

  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Patient type</th>
      <th>Reference range</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Female</td>
      <td>&le; 34 IU/L</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Male</td>
      <td>&le; 45 IU/L</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h1>Elevated levels</h1>
<p>
Significantly elevated levels of ALT (SGPT) often suggest the existence of other medical problems 
such as viral hepatitis, diabetes, congestive heart failure, liver damage, bile duct problems, 
infectious mononucleosis, or myopathy, so ALT is commonly used as a way of screening for liver 
problems. 
</p>
<p>
Elevated ALT may also be caused by dietary choline deficiency. However, elevated levels of ALT 
do not automatically mean that medical problems exist. Fluctuation of ALT levels is normal over 
the course of the day, and they can also increase in response to strenuous physical exercise.

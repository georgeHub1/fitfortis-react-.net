<p>
Many media reports describe either dry statistics about the COVID-19 pandemic or report heavy cases, 
which, although heartbreaking, represent a small percentage of all COVID-19 sick people. Here, we try to fill the gap, presenting various disease courses, most of them from the real clinical practice.</p>

<h1>Local Patient Zero</h1>
<p>
A patient with flu-like symptoms visits a local GP practice. She has mild flu-like symptoms, 
but does not believe to be a COVID-19 patient. Unfortunately, a mistake. She has no face mask. After 
speaking with the receptionist, she enters the GP office. Jane, a 60-year-old general practitioner, who 
has a standard surgical mask (N95) and gloves, examines the patient. A nurse with a standard surgical 
mask (N95) is present in the room as well, but only types on the PC without close contact with the patient. 
Jane follows all necessary protection protocols (mask and gloves) until suddenly 
3 days later she starts feeling sick &ndash; general weakness and fever around 100.4-100.8‚Å∞F. 
Until this moment, she met many patients and her colleagues in the practice, but has always been wearing 
a face mask and gloves. Her throat swab sample is tested with a PCR test to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. 
Positive is also the test of that initial patient, 6 days ago. Jane's colleagues in the office, as well as 
all patients she has consulted for the last 6 days are tested and quarantined for 14 days. None of 
them contracts COVID-19 from Jane. However, the nurse present in the office with Jane 
when the initial COVID-19 patient came, is tested positive too. The 17-old-nurse never develops any 
symptoms.
</p>

<p>
Jane has met with some friends during the 6-day-period before her symptoms occurred &ndash; not in 
large groups, just for coffee, and strictly maintained the recommended social distancing. None of these 
people contracted the virus. Not so happy is the family of Jane &ndash; her husband (65) and both her 
daughters (16 and 20) turn out to be COVID-19 positive too. The 16-year-old daughter has hardly any 
symptoms and tests negative for the virus a week later. The 20-year-old daughter has 2-3 days of mild fever. 
After this, she recovers and is tested SARS-CoV-2-negative too. The 65-year-old husband of Jane has 
average fever in the first few days, initially actively doing some work at home. Then, he raises fever 
for several days, feels weak and accidentally faints once, but decides not to search medical help. Indeed, 
in the next few days, he recovers completely and has no further complaints. Jane is the one with the 
longest and most severe disease course. She starts coughing, but not much. Much more unpleasant is 
the fever, returning constantly, mostly at night, for a period of 12 days. General weakness, "worse 
than anything I have experienced before" plagues Jane. 2 weeks later she starts recovering. Already 
feeling well, her first control throat swab test shows viruses present and she is required to stay at 
home until two more tests a week later come negative. Over the next 2-3 weeks, Jane slowly recovers her 
strength and starts working again.
</p>

<h2>What is important?</h2>
<p>
This real-life example shows that social distancing and personal protection (e.g. masks) do help  
protect others from the virus. Unfortunately, the person using them is less protected.
</p>
<p>
3 out of 5 patients are young (&lt;20) and they develop mild or no symptoms at all. The other 2, 
in their 60s, show more serious symptoms. None of them, however, requires hospital treatment 
or supplementary oxygen.
</p>

<h1>Current knowledge about COVID-19</h1>
<p>
The virus causing COVID-19 (this term is used to indicate the disease) belongs to the group of the 
betacoronaviruses and is named SARS-CoV-2. 79% of its makeup is identical that that of the  
SARS-CoV virus which caused the major SARS disease outbreak in 2002-2003 (1). There is one more virus 
similar to both of them that caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. This virus was named 
MERS-CoV. Initially, it affected camels in the Middle East and contaminated humans only accidentally. 
The most affected region by MERS was Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>
The SARS virus of 2002-2003 caused a disease with higher lethality than COVID-19 (more of the sick 
people died), but it was much less contagious than COVID-19. The reason now is known &ndash; the SARS-CoV 
multiplied deep in the airways and required to be transmitted after coughing with droplets coming 
deep from the lungs of a sick person into the deep airways of another healthy person - not a very probable 
event. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this has changed &ndash; the virus multiplies directly already around 
the tonsils and the throat (much "higher" in the airways than the SARS one), making it much easier 
to be spit out (even exhaled) and be inhaled by a healthy person. This explains why it is much more 
contagious than its cousin causing SARS (2).
</p>
<p>
The SARS-CoV-2 virus cannot infect all cells in our bodies, but only the ones having a special 
protein on its surface &ndash; the ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor. This resembles 
a key and a lock &ndash; the key fits only in some locks and opens not all, but only some doors. 
These "doors" are the lungs, the throat, the heart and the blood vessels, the bowel, the kidney 
and some others. In patients with heart diseases, high blood pressure or diabetes, the amount of 
ACE2 is elevated and some believe it is the cause for a heavier disease course in these patients.
</p>

<h2>Epidemiology</h2>
<p>
Heartbreaking images/reports of beautiful young people dying from COVID-19 cannot leave anybody 
indifferent. The tragedy of the statistics is that even 0.2% dying in the young age groups still 
represents the precious lives of loved daughters, sons, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives. Nevertheless, 
the dry facts indicate that most of the deaths (90% of them) are in patients older than 70, with 50% of all 
COVID-19 deaths in patients above 80 (3). The general lethality of COVID-19 still remains between 2 and 3%.

</p>
<p>
This does not mean that younger people do not need hospital care, but their chances of recovery are 
much higher than of elderly people. One of the problems with elderly patients is that their bodies 
tolerate mechanical ventilation generally less favorably than younger people and this is independent 
on the COVID-19 infection.
</p>
<p>
The current knowledge shows that most affected are always people in groups/clusters exposed to the 
virus &ndash; commuters during rush hours, nursing homes and hospitals. Therefore, we need to be extra 
careful when using public transportation, when visiting our loved ones in hospitals or in nursing homes. 
Face masks (remember the story of Jane) do help.
</p>

<h2>Clinical experience</h2>
<p>
The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (98% of all patients), cough (55%), weakness and 
muscle aches (44%). Half of the patients complain from <strong>dyspnea</strong> (4). What is hidden 
behind the term "dyspnea"? It is the feeling of the patient that she/he cannot breathe 
well enough, that the air is insufficient and one needs more. Our lungs take oxygen from the air into 
the blood, while the unnecessary CO<sub>2</sub> is released from the blood into the lungs and in the 
air during expiration. Very often, the dyspnea is just a warning feeling and the body still gets enough 
oxygen from the air, but warns that care should be taken. How do doctors measure the objective amount of 
oxygen in the blood? The fastest approach is by measuring the <strong>oxygen saturation </strong>of the 
blood. If the maximum amount of oxygen our blood can bind is 100%, the saturation measures how much of 
this maximum is achieved. A healthy person has a saturation between 97-100%. It is measured by a pulse 
oximeter, using the absorption of red light by the finger.

<p>
Roughly, if saturation drops down strongly, supplementary oxygen is given. During viral pneumonia 
(viral inflammation of the lungs as in the COVID-19 case), dyspnea and drop in saturation is often seen. 
In such cases, oxygen supplement though the mouth/nose is sufficient &ndash; normal air contains 21% oxygen, 
when we add 100% oxygen to it, saturation improves.

Most of the patients with heavier COVID-19 course benefit already from this type of therapy. When
examining them with a stethoscope, the doctor does not hear much, but notices that their saturation is lower. 
If the doctors make a CT scan, they notice the typical picture of "ground glass opacity":

Let us compare the image above with a normal lung image from a healthy patient &ndash; you notice that 
the normal lungs are "darker" and smoother &ndash; they are more transparent and there is less fluid 
in the lungs. During inflammation (as in the case of COVID-19), the lungs are inflamed and, similarly 
to an inflamed finger, are swollen and have more fluid inside.

<p>
One of the serious problems in COVID-19 cases that reach hospitals is the excessive, too strong body 
inflammation &ndash; much stronger than it should normally be during such infections. As mentioned already, 
it is the case only in a very small fraction of patients.
</p>

<p>
In few patients, even supplementary oxygen cannot help and they require machine ventilation. There are 
several types of it. One of them is the CPAP machine &ndash; you continue breathing normally, but the 
machine just helps you with additional pressure using a normal pastic face mask (as the one above). If 
you have night apnea, you may be using a similar machine at home. Unfortunately, the CPAP breathing 
support is not good enough for patients with a heavy COVID-19 course. Here, the doctors need to use 
the "classical" machine ventilation you know from the movies. During this procedure, a special tube 
is inserted in the windpipe (a procedure known as <strong>intubation</strong>), the patient is put 
into sleep and the machine takes over completely the control of breathing. The doctors can do many 
things here in a way, which the sick lung cannot do - they can pump in with higher pressure, can keep 
the air longer in the lungs and many more helpful "tricks". It is really a complex approach. During 
this procedure, however, COVID-19 has shown its most challenging nature. It requires completely different 
ventilation specifications compared to all other known viral infections of the lungs. Therefore, doctors 
were not immediately prepared to deal with it. Shortly, COVID-19 does not require higher pressure from 
the machine, but more oxygen in the air mix and longer pauses after breathing in. Increase in the pumping 
pressure, which works for many other diseases of the lungs, can even damage them here and worsen the condition.
</p>

<p>
Nobody knows how long a patient will require machine ventilation. Younger patients can recover faster,
older &ndash; slower. The bodies of older patients in principle do not "like" machine ventilation - 
their lungs, heart, brains and vessels get easier damaged there. Therefore, sometimes, doctors can 
decide not to attach an older patient to a machine and just leave her/him to oxygen only. They do not 
try to play God, they simply know that the chance the ventilation can damage the patient is higher than 
the damage caused by the virus. This is sometimes difficult to accept, but it follows the major medical 
rule &ndash; do as little damage as possible.
</p>

<p>
The lungs are not the only organ attacked by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the heart is another one. This is another 
hypothesis why people with heart diseases suffer heavier &ndash; their heart are already damaged and any 
further damage by a virus can make it worse. Unfortunately, many people above 70 already have different 
forms of heart diseases, making their treatment much more challenging.
</p>

<h1>Conclusions</h1>
<ul>
<li>Most of the lethal cases (&gt;90%) involve elderly people with multiple diseases, but even younger people suffer and are admitted to ICU &ndash; they simply have better recovery chances.</li>
<li>Face masks provide protection against infecting other people.</li>
<li>The virus is more contagious than the SARS virus (2002-2003) because it starts multiplying already in the throat and not only deep in the lungs.</li>
<li>Younger patients have much milder symptoms than older patients do.</li>
<li>Many patients admitted to a hospital get better after oxygen support and they do not require machine ventilation.</li>
<li>In hospitals, some patients require machine ventilation, which represents a challenge &ndash; COVID-19 is different from any other similar diseases, it requires completely different machine settings.</li>

Reliable testing for COVID-19 is key in the fight against the endemic virus. Here's what you should
know about the available test technology.
</p>

<h1>Types of tests</h1>
<p>
There are two major types of tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2:
</p>
<ul>
<li>PCR methods</li>
<li>Serological methods</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here, we present you all major facts about these two approaches, their usefulness, their
limitations and their accessibility.
</p>

<h1>RT-qPCR detection of SARS-CoV-2</h1>
<p>
You listen all the time about the &ldquo;classic&rdquo; testing for SARS-Cov-2 Virus -
the RT-qPCR approach. It detects directly the genetic material of the virus in your throat,
using a method called &ldquo;polymerase chain reaction&rdquo;. Here, the lab directly
proves that the patient carries the virus and is either carrier of sick.
</p>

<p>
After the healthcare provider collects the sample in your throat with a sterile swab,
the genetic material of the virus (in this specific case it is RNA, although there
are many viruses that have DNA instead of RNA) is released by a special solution
cracking the viral surface once the swab is dipped in it. The RNA is copied into DNA
to make laboratory detection easier, since it is very difficult to work with RNA. This
procedure of RNA-translation-into-DNA is called &ldquo;reverse transcription&rdquo;
(the RT in the RT-PCR abbreviation) and is done by a protein enzyme called <strong>reverse
transcriptase</strong>.
</p>

<p>
Now, the sample contains the viral DNA, copied from the RNA, but still its amount
is very low. We have two problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to increase the amount of DNA to detectabe (visible) levels.</li>
<li>We have to be sure that we detect exactly the DNA copied from the virus and not
from another virus, bacteria or from a human.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Both of these tasks are achieved by using the unique PCR method &ndash; the polymerase
chain reaction &ndash; which has revolutionized the field of  molecular biology the last 35 years.
The PCR principle was discovered by Kary Mullis in 1983 when he was working at Cetus
Corporation. For his discovery, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993.
</p>
<p>
But how exactly does the PCR work? The DNA comprises two complementary chains. The
same is valid for the DNA we have copied from the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the reverse
transcriptase above. First, the sample is heated to 200⁰F for 30-60 seconds to split the
DNA into two single DNA chains. Next, the sample is cooled down to allow some DNA
building blocks we add to the sample beforehand to bind to each of the split DNA
strands. Finally, an enzyme called <b>DNA polymerase</b> starts sticking
these building blocks to each other to create a new complementary chain along the
initial DNA strands. At the end of the procedure, there are two new double DNA strands.
This procedure &ndash; sequential heating and cooling &ndash; is repeated 30-60 times
to obtain enough amount to be visible by other methods (for example using a special
dye). At each heating-cooling cycle, the amount of DNA is doubled.

<p>
The real trick to make the PCR working is the special DNA polymerase inside
&ndash; the so-called <b>Taq-Polymerase</b>. It is isolated from the
bacterium <em>Thermus aquaticus</em>, which lives in very hot underwater lakes
around underwater volcanoes. The Taq-Polymeraze remains functional after being heated to
200⁰F and this makes it suitable as a component in the PCR mix during the multiple
heating-and-cooling cycles.
</p>

<p>
But how are we sure that the amplified DNA is the right one &ndash; the one of SARS-CoV-2
and not of something else? For this purpose, the first building block we add at the beginning
of the PCR procedure to the sample (the so-called <b>primer</b>) needs to be
specially designed to fit only the viral genes and nothing else. Even minimal difference
will not allow the primer to find its place in the sample DNA strands and the Taq-Polymerase
will not do anything, it will not amplify the sample DNA. Designing such PCR
primers is a routine, but challenging procedure. There are virtually thousands of companies
that synthesize them according to the wishes of researches, who send the required primer
structure as a file to the company. Designing good primers is key in a successful PCR
detection procedure.
</p>

<p>
A normal PCR procedure requires 2-3 hours and a special fast-heating / fast-cooling PCR machine.
Many companies, including the CDC, prepare PCR kits, including everything needed for
SARS-CoV-2 detection &ndash; solutions, reverse transcriptase, Taq-Polymerase, dyes for
detection of the final product. To speed up the whole procedure, several companies have developed
faster tests, in which the cycles are much shorter and the detection possible with less DNA.
The disadvantage &ndash; all of them require company-specific equipment, for which the test
was optimized.
</p>
<p>
Such faster tests (more are continuously authorized) are produced by the following companies:
</p>

</p>

<p>In the US, all PCR test kits for SARS-CoV-2 require authorization and proof by the FDA &ndash; the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration.</p>

<h1>Antibody (serological) SARS-CoV-2 detection tests </h1>
<p>
These are widely known as &ldquo;rapid tests&rdquo;. They detect the presence of antibodies
(immunoglobulins) in the blood of patients that have already been in contact with the virus.
</p>

<p>
What is an antibody? Our immune system is amazingly effective, it recognizes foreign bodies/bacteria/viruses,
and develops effective, exactly targeted weapons &ndash; antibodies &ndash; against them. The antibodies are
proteins, which are built up to bind very precisely with the invaders, and help destroy them. In the beginning,
several days after the beginning of the infection, the large antibody type IgM is created; several
days/weeks later, it is replaced by another antibody type &ndash; IgG. IgM is very effective,
but deals only with the acute phase of infection, while the IgG persist longer and provides long-term
protection. While the antibodies are very effective in the fight against the virus, they require several
days to be produced in sufficient amount and to be detected.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; tests detect any of these antibodies in the blood, but they are not useful in
the first days of infection because of the delay in antibody production &ndash; therefore, at the beginning
of the infection we need a PCR test. Thus, the rapid tests can be a useful tool to find people with
immunity, but not for immediate diagnosis.
</p>

<p>
Such tests have several weaknesses:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>They may be not sensitive enough and may require really high amounts of the antibodies to show a
positive result. In such cases, a person that is immune may appear not immune.</li>
<li>They may be not precise enough and detect falsely something else in the blood, telling wrongly that
someone is immune against the virus.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The FDA requires an official approval for all RT-qPCR-based tests, but
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-serological-test-validation-and-education-efforts" target="_blank">
not for antibody (serological) tests</a>. Manufacturers are encouraged to send such tests for validation
to FDA, but they are not obliged to do it. Many Internet sites sell such rapid home tests that are
produced abroad (e.g. in China). Many of them are not independently verified to be precise
and sensitive enough. For example, Spain ordered 600,000 such tests in March 2020, discovering
later that their precision does not exceed 30%, which makes them useless. We strongly encourage
you to check and re-check all the evidence about the reliability of such tests provided by their
manufacturer.
</p>

<p>
Antibody (serological) tests can be in two forms:
<ol>
<li>
<b>Paper chromatography home tests</b> &ndash; typically working by visualization of an interaction
band on paper carrier. Most of the commercially available ones are not precise enough and provide
many false positive and false negative results.
</li>
<li>
<b>ELISA-based laboratory tests</b> &ndash; tests using a method called ELISA (Enzyme-Linked
ImmunoSorbent Assay) where many conditions can be optimized/adjusted in the laboratory and
the detection procedure is cross-checked with confirmed-positive or negative control samples.
These tests are more precise than the paper chromatography ones. ELISA cannot be performed at home,
though, and even here, there are good and not-so-good providers. A recent work from Denmark
compares several such test manufacturers and provides useful information about the reliable
and the less reliable companies (1).
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Several large diagnostic firms work in this direction. The two most promising at the moment are the
<a href="https://www.roche.com/media/releases/med-cor-2020-04-17.htm"
target="_blank">antibody tests of Roche</a> and <a href="https://www.corelaboratory.abbott/us/en/offerings/segments/infectious-disease/sars-cov-2"
target="_blank">Abbott</a> among others. Similarly to their RT-qPCR tests, they need to be
performed on companies&rsquo; own diagnostic machines.
</p>

<p>
At the moment, available serology tests have to be considered with care. While they can confirm the
presence of immunity, they cannot be used as a marker for an active infection. Still, the best proof
for an active or past infection is sample analysis from a well-reputed health care provider or laboratory.

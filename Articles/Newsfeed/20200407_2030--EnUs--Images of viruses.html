The COVID-19 pandemic has sparked a renewed interest in viruses.

<h1 id="1">Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus (1975)</h1>
<p>
This 1975, digitally colorized transmission electron microscopic (TEM) image, depicted
four avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) virions, which are Coronaviridae family
members. IBV is a highly contagious pathogen, which infects poultry of all ages, affecting
a number of organ systems, including the respiratory and urogenital organs. IBV possesses
a helical genome, composed of non-segmented, positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+) ssRNA).
This is an enveloped virus, which means that its outermost covering is derived from the
host cell membrane. The coronavirus derives its name from the fact that under electron
microscopic examination, each virion is surrounded by a corona, or halo, due to the
presence of viral spike peplomers emanating from its proteinaceous capsid.

<h1 id="2">SARS-CoV Electron Microscopic Images (2003, 2004)</h1>
<p>
This 2003 photomicrograph of a lung tissue specimen, revealed some of the histopathologic
changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV).
Histopathology included diffuse alveolar damage, and in the center of the image was a
multinucleated giant cell with no conspicuous viral inclusions.

This digitally colorized scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image revealed the thickened,
layered edge of SARS infected Vero E6 culture cells. The thickened edges of the infected
cells were ruffled, and appeared to be comprised of layers of folded plasma membranes.
Note the layered cell edge (arrows). Virus particles (arrowheads) are extrude from the
layered surfaces.

This digitally colorized scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image reveals the exportation
of virus particles (arrows) on the pseudopodial and cell surfaces. This image was captured
15 to 24 hours after the Vero E6 culture cells were infected with the SARS-CoV
(coronavirus). The increased numbers of pseudopodia were a direct, post-infection,
cell surface transformation, as well.

This digitally colorized scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image reveals the prolific
exportation of virus particles on the pseudopodial, and cell surfaces. This image was
captured 15 to 24 hours after the Vero E6 culture cells were infected with the SARS-CoV
(coronavirus). The increased numbers of pseudopodia were a direct, post-infection
cell surface transformation, as well.

<p>
This digitally colorized scanning electron microscopic (SEM) image of SARS-infected
Vero E6 cells, and the non-colorized original image below it revealed the protrusion of
knobby, rosette-like viruses from the edges of the cell. These findings were evident
15-hours after these Vero E6 cells were infected with SARS-CoV, also known as the coronavirus.
The knobby textured virus membrane is very much evident under the higher magnification of
the inset, where a virus is being extruded (arrow).

This illustration, created at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), reveals
ultrastructural morphology exhibited by coronaviruses. Note the spikes that adorn the outer
surface of the virus, which impart the look of a corona surrounding the virion, when viewed
electron microscopically. In this view, the envelope (E) protein, spike (S) glycoprotein, and membrane (M) protein particles located on
the outer surface of the particle, have all been labeled as well. The nucleocapsid (N) protein is not visible, being inside the virion.
</p>
<p>
Spike glycoprotein is the most important surface protein of coronavirus, which can mediate the entrance to human respiratory epithelial cells by interacting with cell surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The spike glycoprotein includes two regions, S1 and S2, where S1 is for host cell receptor binding and S2 is for membrane fusion. Spike glycoprotein is a key target for vaccines, therapeutic antibodies, and diagnostics.
</p>
<p>
A novel coronavirus,
named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as
the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China in 2019.
The illness caused by this virus has been named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

The founders of Instagram Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have launched <a href="https://rt.live">https://Rt.live</a> -- 
a live tracker of how fast COVID-19 is spreading in each US state.
</p>

<p>
R<sub>t</sub> measures the average number of people who become infected by an infectious person. 
It is a temporal extension of R<sub>0</sub> (pronounced "R naught") for day "t" after the introduction 
of a disease to a population. R<sub>0</sub> measures the infectiousness of a disease at time "0", i.e. 
when everyone in a population is completely vulnerable to the disease.
</p>

<p>
Three possibilities exist for the potential spread or decline of a disease, depending on its R<sub>t</sub> 
value:
</p>

</p>
<ul>
<li>If R<sub>t</sub> &lt; 1, each existing infection causes less than one new infection. In this 
case, the disease will decline and eventually die out.</li>
<li>If R<sub>t</sub> = 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. The disease will stay 
alive and stable, but there wonâ€™t be an outbreak or an epidemic.</li>
<li>If R<sub>t</sub> &gt; 1, each existing infection causes more than one new infection. The 
disease will spread between people, and there may be an outbreak or epidemic.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The higher above the number 1, the faster COVID-19 races through a population, while a number below 
1 shows the virus receding.

<p>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as the name shows are diseases of the heart (including the blood vessels of the heart &ndash; the coronary arteries), of the body vessels and brain vessels. When the blood supply of the heart is blocked, we have symptoms of a heart attack, when the brain arteries are affected - we speak about stroke. The World Health Organization provides the following statistics about CVD worldwide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the number 1 cause of death globally: more people die annually from CVDs than from any other cause.</li>
<li>An estimated 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2016, representing 31% of all global deaths. Of these deaths, 85% are due to heart attack and stroke.</li>
<li>Over three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and middle-income countries.</li>
<li>Out of the 17 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to noncommunicable diseases in 2015, 82% are in low- and middle-income countries, and 37% are caused by CVDs.</li>
<li>Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.</li>
<li>People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management using counselling and medicines, as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<h1>What causes vascular diseases?</h1>
<p>The causes of vascular diseases depend on the specific disease. These causes include</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetics</li>
<li>Heart diseases such as high cholesterol and high blood pressure</li>
<li>Infection</li>
<li>Injury</li>
<li>Medicines, including hormones</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the cause is unknown.</p>
<h1>Who is at risk for vascular diseases?</h1>
<p>The risk factors for vascular diseases can vary, depending on the specific disease. But some of the more common risk factors include</p>
<ul>
<li>Age - your risk of some diseases goes up as you get older</li>
<li>Conditions that can affect the heart and blood vessels, such as diabetes or high cholesterol</li>
<li>Family history of vascular or heart diseases</li>
<li>Infection or injury that damages your veins</li>
<li>Lack of exercise</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Pregnancy</li>
<li>Sitting or standing still for long periods of time</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
</ul>
<h1>Focus on: Heart Attack</h1>
<p>Heart attacks most often occur as a result of ischemic heart disease, also called coronary heart disease or coronary artery disease. Ischemic heart disease&nbsp;is a condition in which a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.</p>
<p>When plaque builds up in the arteries, the condition is called atherosclerosis. The buildup of plaque occurs over many years.</p>
<p>Eventually, an area of plaque can rupture (break open) inside of an artery. This causes a blood clot to form on the plaque's surface. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow through a coronary artery.</p>
<p>If the blockage isn't treated quickly, the portion of heart muscle fed by the artery begins to die. Healthy heart tissue is replaced with scar tissue. This heart damage may not be obvious, or it may cause severe or long-lasting problems.</p>

</div>
<p>A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery. Spasms can occur in coronary arteries that aren't affected by atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>Heart attacks can be associated with or lead to severe health problems, such as heart failure and life-threatening arrhythmias.</p>
<p>Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Arrhythmias are irregular heartbeats. Ventricular fibrillation is a life-threatening arrhythmia that can cause death if not treated right away.</p>
<p><em><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Don't Wait--Get Help Quickly</span></strong></em></p>
<p>Acting fast at the first sign of heart attack symptoms can save your life and limit damage to your heart. Treatment works best when it's given right after symptoms occur.</p>
<p>Many people aren't sure what's wrong when they are having symptoms of a heart attack. Some of the most common warning symptoms of a heart attack for both men and women are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chest pain or discomfort.</strong>&nbsp;Most heart attacks involve discomfort in the center or left side of the chest. The discomfort usually lasts more than a few minutes or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion.</li>
<li><strong>Upper body discomfort.</strong>&nbsp;You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach (above the belly button).</li>
<li><strong>Shortness of breath.</strong>&nbsp;This may be your only symptom, or it may occur before or along with chest pain or discomfort. It can occur when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other possible symptoms of a heart attack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breaking out in a cold sweat</li>
<li>Feeling unusually tired for no reason, sometimes for days (especially if you are a woman)</li>
<li>Nausea (feeling sick to the stomach) and vomiting</li>
<li>Light-headedness or sudden dizziness</li>
<li>Any sudden, new symptom or a change in the pattern of symptoms you already have (for example, if your symptoms become stronger or last longer than usual)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all heart attacks begin with the sudden, crushing chest pain that often is shown on TV or in the movies, or other common symptoms such as chest discomfort. The symptoms of a heart attack can vary from person to person. Some people can have few symptoms and are surprised to learn they've had a heart attack. If you've already had a heart attack, your symptoms may not be the same for another one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em>Quick Action Can Save Your Life: Call 9&ndash;1&ndash;1</em></strong></span></p>
<p>If you think you or someone else may be having heart attack symptoms or a heart attack, don't ignore it or feel embarrassed to call for help. <em><strong>Call 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 for emergency medical care</strong></em>. Acting fast can save your life.</p>
<p>Do not drive to the hospital or let someone else drive you. Call an ambulance so that medical personnel can begin life-saving treatment on the way to the emergency room. Take a nitroglycerin pill if your doctor has prescribed this type of treatment.</p>
<h1>Treatment</h1>
<p>Early treatment for a heart attack can prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. Acting fast, <strong><em>by calling 9&ndash;1&ndash;1</em></strong> at the first symptoms of a heart attack, can save your life. Medical personnel can begin diagnosis and treatment even before you get to the hospital.</p>
<h1>Immediate Treatment</h1>
<p>Certain treatments usually are started right away if a heart attack is suspected, even before the diagnosis is confirmed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aspirin to prevent further blood clotting</li>
<li>Nitroglycerin to reduce your heart&rsquo;s workload and improve blood flow through the coronary arteries</li>
<li>Oxygen therapy</li>
<li>Treatment for chest pain</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the diagnosis of a heart attack is confirmed or strongly suspected, doctors start treatments promptly to try to restore blood flow through the blood vessels supplying the heart. The two main treatments are clot-busting medicines and percutaneous coronary intervention, also known as coronary angioplasty, a procedure used to open blocked coronary arteries.</p>
<p><strong>Clot-Busting Medicines</strong></p>
<p>Thrombolytic medicines, also called clot busters, are used to dissolve blood clots that are blocking the coronary arteries. To work best, these medicines must be given within several hours of the start of heart attack symptoms. Ideally, the medicine should be given as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</strong></p>
<p>Percutaneous coronary intervention is a nonsurgical procedure that opens blocked or narrowed coronary arteries. A thin, flexible tube (catheter) with a balloon or other device on the end is threaded through a blood vessel, usually in the groin (upper thigh), to the narrowed or blocked coronary artery. Once in place, the balloon located at the tip of the catheter is inflated to compress the plaque and related clot against the wall of the artery. This restores blood flow through the artery. During the procedure, the doctor may put a small mesh tube called a stent in the artery. The stent helps to keep the blood vessel open to prevent blockages in the artery in the months or years after the procedure.</p>

<h1>Other Treatments for Heart Attack</h1>
<p>Other treatments for heart attack include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medicines</li>
<li>Medical procedures</li>
<li>Heart-healthy lifestyle changes</li>
<li>Cardiac rehabilitation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Medicines</strong></p>
<p>Your doctor may prescribe one or more of the following medicines.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ACE inhibitors</strong>. ACE inhibitors lower blood pressure and reduce strain on your heart. They also help slow down further weakening of the heart muscle.</li>
<li><strong>Anticlotting medicines</strong>. Anticlotting medicines stop platelets from clumping together and forming unwanted blood clots. Examples of anticlotting medicines include aspirin and clopidogrel.</li>
<li><strong>Anticoagulants</strong>. Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. These medicines also keep existing clots from getting larger.</li>
<li><strong>Beta blockers</strong>. Beta blockers decrease your heart&rsquo;s workload. These medicines also are used to relieve chest pain and discomfort and to help prevent another heart attack. Beta blockers also are used to treat arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats).</li>
<li><strong>Statin medicines</strong>. Statins control or lower your blood cholesterol. By lowering your blood cholesterol level, you can decrease your chance of having another heart attack or&nbsp;stroke.</li>
</ul>
<p>You also may be given medicines to relieve pain and anxiety, and treat arrhythmias.&nbsp;Take all medicines regularly, as your doctor prescribes. Don&rsquo;t change the amount of your medicine or skip a dose unless your doctor tells you to.</p>

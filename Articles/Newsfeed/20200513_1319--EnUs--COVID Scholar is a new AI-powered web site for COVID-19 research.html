<p>
A team of scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have created an AI-powered tool 
for mining of scientific publications related to COVID-19.
</p>

<p>
The tool, available at <a href="https://covidscholar.org">covidscholar.org</a>, allows anyone 
interested in COVID-19 research to search tens of thousands of research papers, using natural 
language search queries. 
</p>

<p>
The use of AI (artificial intelligence) enables not only powerful search, but also <b>discovery of 
new scientific knowledge</b>. The latter was demonstrated in a 
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1335-8">study</a> where an AI-based 
algorithm was able to predict new discoveries from "latent knowledge" present in 
scientific publications.

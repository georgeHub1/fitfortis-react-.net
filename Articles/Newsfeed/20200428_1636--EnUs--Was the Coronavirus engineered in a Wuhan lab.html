Was the new Coronavirus "engineered" in a Wuhan lab, by using artificial selection techniques? 
A <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/controversial-wuhan-lab-experiments-that-may-have-started-coronavirus-pandemic-1500503?fbclid=IwAR0DuS863_J_BtYmIMQC43fqsxr0PmBOXhNtWYJBV7yZDIwDxXen1BgwIrY">Newsweek article</a> suggests that may indeed be the case.

<li>
In March 2020, <b>US intelligence agencies acknowledged the possibility</b> that SARS-CoV-2, the Coronavirus that 
causes COVID-19, originated in a Chinese lab. Previously, it was believed that the virus originated naturally 
and spred from the wet market in Wuhan. 
</li>
<li>
So far, the virus has <b>infected at least 3.1M</b> and has <b>killed more than 210,000</b> people worldwide. 
The US alone has ~60K fatalities. 
</li>
<li>
The <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/">Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV)</a> has collected more bat coronaviruses 
than any other virology lab in the world. WIV has also conducted experiments to <b>engineer viruses artificially</b>. 
The institute has published only <a href="http://english.whiov.cas.cn/sylbt2016/202004/t20200419_234986.html">
4 scientific publications</a> on the topic of viral research in 2020.
</li>
<li>
In 2018, the institute <b>built a BSL-4 lab</b>, enabling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_passage">transmissibility 
(serial passage) experiments</a>. In these experiments, the virus is injected into one animal. When the animal gets sick, viral 
particles from its body are injected into another animal. This process is repeated until an animal catches the disease only 
by exposure to another sick animal. 
</li>
<li>
The animals used in the transmissibility experiments are typically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferret">ferrets</a>, 
considered to be <b>good stand-in for humans</b>. 
</li>
<li>
Transmissibility experiments in animals are <b>controversial</b>, because they result in the creation of dangerous viruses 
through artificial selection. Selection is an indirect genetic engineering technique, so mutations in the virus are 
completely consistent with natural evolution. 
</li>
<li>
US diplomatic communication from 2018 shows that the <b>US embassy staff were worried about the experiments</b> conducted at the lab for 
fear that a virus could escape the lab and cause a pandemic. According to Josh Rogin in the Washington Post, the two diplomatic 
cables that were dispatched to Washington "warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab".

<h1>Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) labs</h1>
<p>
Research on dangerious biological agents is performed in special enclosed laboratory facilities, differentiated by their 
levels of containment. The levels of containment range from the lowest biosafety level 1 (BSL-1) to the highest at 
level 4 (BSL-4). These levels are specified by the CDC in the United States, and by a directive in the EU.
</p>
<p>
Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) is the highest level of biosafety precautions, and is appropriate for work with agents 
that could easily be aerosol-transmitted within the laboratory and cause severe to fatal disease in humans for 
which there are no available vaccines or treatments.

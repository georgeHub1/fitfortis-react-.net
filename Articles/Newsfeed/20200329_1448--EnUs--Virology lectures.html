COVID-19 has sparked a lot of interest in virology. Professor Vincent Racaniello from Columbia
University has made the lectures from his 2020 virology course publicly available.
</p>

<h1>1. What is a Virus?</h1>
<p>
What is a virus? When were viruses discovered? What are their fundamental properties?
Are viruses alive?

<h1>2. The Infectious Cycle</h1>
<p>
The complete course of events in a virus infected cell is known as the infectious cycle. This
lecture discusses the different parts of the infectious cycle and how to study them, including assay
of infectious virus particles by plaque assay, multiplicity of infection, and the particle-to-PFU
ratio.

<h1>3. Genomes and Genetics</h1>
<p>
The viral genome is the blueprint for making new virus particles. Based on the pathway to mRNA, there
are 7 types of DNA and RNA viral genomes. The lecture discusses the largest and smallest genomes, what
is and is not encoded in the genome, and how to manipulate the viral genomes to facilitate their study
and their use as vectors.

<h1>4. Structure of Viruses</h1>
<p>
Virus particles are constructed in three ways: with helical, icosahedral, or complex symmetry. This lecture discusses the principles of helical and icosahedral symmetry and how larger and larger viruses are assembled. Some particles are wrapped with a lipid envelope, derived from the host cell, which is embedded with viral glycoproteins.

    </div>
</p>

<h1>5. Attachment and Entry</h1>
<p>
Viruses must enter cells to replicate, but they are too large to pass through the membrane of the cell. Instead, viruses bind surface receptors for entry into the cell. In this lecture we discuss how virus particles attach to cell receptors, the triggers for genome release from icosahedral and enveloped viruses, and how membrane fusion is regulated.

</p>

<h1>6. RNA Directed RNA Synthesis</h1>
<p>
RNA virus genomes are copied into mRNA by a viral enzyme, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, which
has no counterpart in the cell. In this lecture we discuss the principles and mechanisms of RNA
synthesis by these enzymes, including priming of RNA synthesis, how mRNA and genomes are produced
in infected cells, and the switch from synthesis of mRNAs to genomes.

<h1>7. Transcription and RNA Processing</h1>
<p>
When DNA viral genomes enter the cell, the first biosynthetic step is transcription, which can
only occur on double-stranded templates. In this lecture, we discuss DNA dependent RNA
polymerase, regulation of transcription by viral proteins, positive feedback loops and
transcriptional cascades, and RNA processing, the addition of 5'-cap, poly(A) tail, splicing,
noncoding RNAs and RNA methylation.</p>

</p>

<h1>8. Viral DNA Replication</h1>
<p>
In this lecture we reveal the mechanisms of DNA replication, including how origin-binding proteins
recruit the host synthetic apparatus, replication by strand displacement or a replication fork,
solving the 5'-end problem caused by RNA priming, and how viral genomes ensure that cells are actively
duplicating their DNA to provide access to the DNA synthesis machinery.

<h1>9. Reverse Transcription and Integration</h1>
<p>
In this lecture we discuss reverse transcriptase, an enzyme that produces DNA from RNA. Its discovery
has revolutionized biology. the mechanism of reverse transcription and integration, and its role in
the reproduction cycles of retroviruses and hepatitis B virus. We also introduce retroelements, mobile
DNA sequences that move about the genome through the action of reverse transcriptase, which make up
an amazing 42% of the human genome.

<h1>10. Assembly </h1>
<p>
In this lecture we discuss the mechanisms for assembly of new virus particles, including sequential or
concerted assembly line processes, packaging of nucleic acids, acquisition of an envelope, and release
from the infected cell.
</p>

<h1>11. The Infected Cell</h1>
<p>
Viral reproduction places enormous demands on the host cell's biosynthetic and metabolic capabilities.
In this lecture we present an integrated description of how virus infection redirects and often compromises
normal cell physiology, including metabolism, RNA and protein synthesis, signal transduction pathways,
and trafficking systems.

<h1>12. Infection Basics</h1>
<p>
This course now moves from explaining virus infection in cell culture to a discussion of viral pathogenesis,
the process by which viruses cause disease. In this lecture we cover fundamental aspects of how viruses
enter hosts, spread to and infect different tissues, transmission to new hosts, and how geography and season
may affect virus infections.

<h1>13. Intrinsic and Innate Defenses</h1>
<p>
In this lecture we cover host barriers against virus infections, which include chemical and physical defenses
such as skin and mucus; intrinsic defenses (always present in the cell), and then innate defenses (which
must be induced by infection). Both are highly effective antiviral systems, but are antagonized by many
different viral proteins, one reason why viruses are successful at being maintained in populations.

<h1>14. Adaptive Immunity</h1>
<p>
The final barrier to virus reproduction in the host is the adaptive immune system, which is tailored to the
pathogen and has memory. In this lecture we examine how B and T cells are instructed by the innate immune
system, how antibodies and cytotoxic T cells are made, and their roles in preventing and resolving virus
infections. Includes explanations of rapid tests for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and antibody therapy for COVID-19 patients.

</p>

<h1>15. Mechanisms of Pathogenesis</h1>
<p>
Viruses cause disease in a host - a process called pathogenesis - through a combination of the effects of
virus replication and the immune response. Topics of this lecture include viral virulence, viral and cell
genes that regulate this property, mechanisms by which CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells and antibodies cause disease,
and how virus infections lead to immunosuppression.

<h1>16. Acute Infections</h1>
<p>
An acute infection is characterized by rapid onset of virus reproduction, a brief but potentially severe
course of disease followed by resolution. In this lecture we define the properties of acute infections,
and illustrate them with five examples: influenza virus, poliovirus, measles virus, norovirus, and
West Nile virus.

<h1>17. Persistent Infections</h1>
<p>
A persistent viral infection typically lasts for the lifetime of the host. In this lecture we discuss
the mechanisms and consequences of viral persistence, illustrated with examples of measles virus,
polyomaviruses, hepatitis B and C viruses, and herpesviruses.

<h1>18. Transformation and Oncogenesis</h1>
<p>
About 20% of human cancers are associated with virus infections. Making cells immortal places them on
the road to cancer. In this lecture we review the discovery of RNA and DNA tumor viruses and how an
understanding of how they transform cells led to an understanding of how cell growth is controlled.

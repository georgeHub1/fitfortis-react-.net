The spike protein that enables the Coronavirus to enter host cells is one of the major 
targets for vaccines and therapeutics. A dominant mutation at the 614 position of the 
spike protein enables the virus to infect cells significantly more efficiently. The 
mutation is found in the US and in European countries.

<h1>Genetic code</h1>
<p>
All living things on Earth are governed by their genetic code, which is encoded 
in the giant polymeric biomolecules - DNA and RNA. The key building blocks of the DNA and RNA 
molecules are called <b>nucleotide bases</b>. These bases serve as "letters" that are 
used to write the genetic code. 
</p>
<p> 
The four RNA bases are Adenine (A), Uracil (U), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C). A 
sequence of 3 bases is called a <b>codon</b>. It takes exactly one codon to encode an amino acid. 
The codons are effectively the "3-letter words" of the genetic code. It is important 
to note that one amino acid can be encoded by several different codons. For example, 
the amino acid Glycine is encoded by all codons starting with GG (GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG). Another amino 
acid - Aspartate - is encoded by codons GAC and GAU.

<h1>Coronavirus mutations</h1>
<p>
Mutations in viruses are very common, and arguably one of the greatest proofs of natural evolution. 
Mutations in the influenza viruses, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/change.htm"></a>for example</a>, 
result in new flu variants and the need for new flu vaccines every season. 
</p>
<p>
Flu viruses mutate relatively quickly, because they lack proofreading mechanisms to 
look for and repair errors during RNA replication. In contrast, the Coronavirus mutates very 
slowly, due to the presence of a <a href="https://fitfortis.com/newsfeed/73f09ec6-6327-43f3-7a32-08d81e554566">proofreading
enzyme (NSP14)</a>. As a whole, the mutation rate of the Coronavirus is less than 0.2%, with 
only about 20 sustained mutations over the course of the pandemic.
</p>


<h1>The D614G mutation</h1>
<p>
The RNA of the Coronavirus contains about 30000 
nucleotide bases, which encode 29 proteins. 4 of the 29 proteins are structural 
proteins, and one of them is the spike (S) protein, which enables the virus to attach to and 
penetrate a host cell.
</p>
<p>
On July 2, <a href="https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30820-5">a 
publication in the scientific journal Cell</a> by UK group of researchers announced 
an observed dominant viral mutation at the 614 codon position of the S protein 
(global nucleotide position 23403). The mutation is denoted as D614G, 
indicating the mutation of Aspartate (D) to Glycine (G). An independent Chinese research 
group published a similar 
<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.161323v1">a paper</a> 
earlier. 
</p>
<p>
The D614G mutation happened as a result of replacing 
an Adenine base with a Guanine base. This resulted in the codon converting from GAC, 
which encodes the amino acid Aspartate (D), to GGC, which encodes the amino acid Glycine (G).
The mutation emerged in China and Germany in late January, and became dominant by Februrary. 
By end of May, <b>78% of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences had the mutation</b>.

<h1>More infectious - same fatality rates</h1>
<p>
The D614G mutation is associated with higher viral loads in COVID-19 patients. The mutation makes 
the virus far more infectious, which could explain why infections exploded in some regions, and not in 
other regions with similar density and characteristics. 
</p>
<p>
At the same time there is no significant association between the mutation and the disease severity 
and hospitalization outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
This is not unexpected. A more infectious, less fatal virus has a higher chance of being successful in 
global evolutionary terms, as it would not kill its hosts before spreading.

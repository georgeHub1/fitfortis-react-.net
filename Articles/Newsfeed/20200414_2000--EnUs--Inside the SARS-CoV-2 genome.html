The new Coronavirus comprises of genetic material (RNA) wrapped in a coat of proteins and lipids. 
RNA (ribonucleic acid) is a long molecule, structured as a sequence of 4 nucleobases — adenine (A), cytosine (C), 
guanine (G), and uracil (U). These bases are the four "letters" of RNA, used to write the instructions for the 
production of the viral proteins.

<h1>3 types of proteins</h1>
<p>
Some of the proteins are part of the structure of the viral particle. Others are utility proteins 
enabling the generation of viral particles inside the host cell. On April 3, 2020, Jonathan Corum and Carl Zimmer published 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/03/science/coronavirus-genome-bad-news-wrapped-in-protein.html">Bad 
News Wrapped in Protein: Inside the Coronavirus Genome</a> in The New York Times. This is an excellent article, which details 
the genetic sequences for the 29 proteins, encoded in the SARS-CoV-2 RNA:  
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
    <b>4 structural proteins (SPs)</b> -- These proteins form the structure of the virion. These are the spike protein (S), 
    the membrane protein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the nucleocapside (N).
</li>
<li>
    <b>16 non-structural proteins (NSPs)</b> -- These proteins get produced in the host cell, with the goal of 
    commandeering the cellular factory for production of viral particles.
</li>
<li>
    <b>9 proteins with other regulatory function (ORF)</b> -- These proteins have accessory roles, such as 
    supressing the immunoresponse of the host cell, etc.
</li>

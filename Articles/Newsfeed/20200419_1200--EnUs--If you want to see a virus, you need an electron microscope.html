Most viruses are too small and cannot be photographed using visible light.
Instead, they are photographed using electron beams. There are 2 types of
electron microscope that are often used to record images of viruses --
SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) and TEM (Transmission Electron Microscope).

<h1>History of electron microscopy</h1>
<p>
The first prototype electron microscope (which was a TEM), capable of 400x
magnification, was developed in 1931 by the physicist Ernst Ruska and
the electrical engineer Max Knoll. The apparatus was the first practical
demonstration of the principles of electron microscopy. In May 1931,
Reinhold Rudenberg, the scientific director of Siemens-Schuckertwerke,
obtained a patent for an electron microscope. In 1932, Ernst Lubcke
of Siemens & Halske built and obtained images from a prototype
electron microscope, applying the concepts described in Rudenberg's patent.

In 1933, Ruska  built the first electron microscope that exceeded the
resolution attainable with an optical (light) microscope. Four years later,
in 1937, Manfred von Ardenne created the scanning electron microscope (SEM).
Siemens produced the first commercial electron microscope in 1938.

<h1>Type of electron microscopes</h1>
<p>
There are several types of electron microscopes:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Transmission electron microscope (TEM)</li>
<li>Scanning electron microscope (SEM)</li>
<li>Reflection electron microscope (REM)</li>
<li>Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)</li>
<li>Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM)</li>
</ol>

<h1>Color</h1>
<p>
Most electron microscopes produce an image with a single brightness value per
pixel, which the results usually rendered in grayscale. These images are then
colorized either manually or by software to clarify structure or for aesthetic
purposes. Colorizations don't add new information to the image.
</p>
<p>
Some electron microscopes can use multiple detectors, assigning different colors
to secondary electron signals, which results in a color image. Electron
microscopes record images of objects that are smaller than the wavelength of
visible light, so strictly speaking, "color" does not have direct meaning in
these images.

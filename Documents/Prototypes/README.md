This directory contains prototypes (the *.xd files) built with Adobe XD CC.

# Running the prototypes:
Here's how to play with the prototypes:
  1. Install [Adobe XD CC](https://creative.adobe.com/products/download/xd) - it's free.
  2. After installation, start Adobe XD, and open the project (File > Open > ff.xd).
  3. Click the "play" button (top right corner) to "play" the project in a web site simulator.

# Modifying the prototype:
First, you need to learn how to use Adobe XD. This will take you about 15 min.
Open Adobe XD, go to Help > XD Tutorial and follow the instructions.

Next, you can start modifying the *.xd files.
The *.xd file is self-contained -- it has all necessary assets, etc.
